// Explicit Conversions

//explicit conversions to make the code clearer

//the simplest way to perform an explicit type conversion is to use the Boolean(), Number(), and String() functions:

console.log(Number('3')); //3
console.log(false); //false: Or use false.toString()
console.log(Boolean([])); //true

// Any value other than null or undefined has a toString() method, and the result of this method is usually the same as that returned by the String() function.
