// For length property, JS provides a rich API for working with strings:

let s = 'Hello, world'; //Start with some text

// Space trimming functions. trim() is ES5; others ES2019
console.log(' test '.trim()); //removes spaces at start and end
console.log(' test '.trimStart()); //removes spaces on left. Also trimLeft
console.log(' test '.trimEnd()); //remove spaces at right. Also trimRight
