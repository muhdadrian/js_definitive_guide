// The instanceof Operator

// The instanceof operator expects a left-side operand that is an object and a right-side operand that identifies a class of objects. The operator evaluates to true if the left-side object is an instance of the right-side class and evaluates to false otherwise. In JavaScript, classes of objects are defined by the constructor function that initializes them. Thus, the right-side operand of instanceof should be a function. Here are examples:
let d = new Date(); // Create a new object with the Date() constructor
d instanceof Date; // => true: d was created with Date()
d instanceof Object; // => true: all objects are instances of Object
d instanceof Number; // => false: d is not a Number object
let a = [1, 2, 3]; // Create an array with array literal syntax
a instanceof Array; // => true: a is an array
a instanceof Object; // => true: all arrays are objects
a instanceof RegExp; // => false: arrays are not regular expressions

// Note that all objects are instances of Object. instanceof considers the “superclasses” when deciding whether an object is an instance of a class. If the left-side operand of instanceof is not an object, instanceof returns false. If the righthand side is not a class of objects, it throws a TypeError.

/*
In order to understand how the instanceof operator works, you must understand the “prototype chain.” This is JavaScript’s inheritance mechanism. To evaluate the expression o instanceof f, JavaScript evaluates f.prototype, and then looks for that value in the prototype chain of o. If it finds it, then o is an instance of f (or of a subclass of f) and the operator returns true. If f.prototype is not one of the values in the prototype chain of o, then o is not an instance of f and instanceof returns false.
